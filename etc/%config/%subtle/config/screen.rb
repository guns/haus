#
# == Screen
#
# Generally subtle comes with two panels per screen, one on the top and one at
# the bottom. Each panel can be configured with different panel items and
# sublets screen wise. The default config uses top panel on the first screen
# only, it's up to the user to enable the bottom panel or disable either one
# or both.

# === Properties
#
# [*stipple*]    This property adds a stipple pattern to both screen panels.
#
#                Example: stipple "~/stipple.xbm"
#                         stipple Subtlext::Icon.new("~/stipple.xbm")
#
# [*top*]        This property adds a top panel to the screen.
#
#                Example: top [ :views, :title ]
#
# [*bottom*]     This property adds a bottom panel to the screen.
#
#                Example: bottom [ :views, :title ]
