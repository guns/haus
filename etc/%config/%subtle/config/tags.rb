#
# == Tags
#
# Tags are generally used in subtle for placement of windows. This placement is
# strict, that means that - aside from other tiling window managers - windows
# must have a matching tag to be on a certain view. This also includes that
# windows that are started on a certain view will not automatically be placed
# there.
#
# There are to ways to define a tag:
#
# === Simple
#
# The simple way just needs a name and a regular expression to just handle the
# placement:
#
# Example:
#
#  tag "terms", "terms"
#
# === Extended
#
# Additionally tags can do a lot more then just control the placement - they
# also have properties than can define and control some aspects of a window
# like the default gravity or the default screen per view.
#
# Example:
#
#  tag "terms" do
#    match   "xterm|[u]?rxvt"
#    gravity :center
#  end
#
# === Default
#
# Whenever a window has no tag it will get the default tag and be placed on the
# default view. The default view can either be set by the user with adding the
# default tag to a view by choice or otherwise the first defined view will be
# chosen automatically.
#
# === Properties
#
# [*borderless*] This property enables the borderless mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: borderless true
#                Links:    http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Borderless
#                          http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Borderless
#
# [*fixed*]      This property enables the fixed mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: fixed true
#                Links:   http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Fixed
#                         http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Fixed
#
# [*float*]      This property enables the float mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: float true
#                Links:   http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Float
#                         http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Float
#
# [*full*]       This property enables the fullscreen mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: full true
#                Links:   http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Fullscreen
#                         http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Fullscreen
#
# [*geometry*]   This property sets a certain geometry as well as floating mode
#                to the tagged client, but only on views that have this tag too.
#                It expects an array with x, y, width and height values whereas
#                width and height must be >0.
#
#                Example: geometry [100, 100, 50, 50]
#                Link:    http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Geometry
#
# [*gravity*]    This property sets a certain to gravity to the tagged client,
#                but only on views that have this tag too.
#
#                Example: gravity :center
#                Link:    http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Gravity
#
# [*match*]      This property adds matching patterns to a tag, a tag can have
#                more than one. Matching works either via plaintext, regex
#                (see man regex(7)) or window id. Per default tags will only
#                match the WM_NAME and the WM_CLASS portion of a client, this
#                can be changed with following possible values:
#
#                [*:name*]      Match the WM_NAME
#                [*:instance*]  Match the first (instance) part from WM_CLASS
#                [*:class*]     Match the second (class) part from WM_CLASS
#                [*:role*]      Match the window role
#                [*:type*]      Match the window type
#
#                Examples: match instance: "urxvt"
#                          match [:role, :class] => "test"
#                          match "[xa]+term"
#                Link:     http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Match
#
# [*position*]   Similar to the geometry property, this property just sets the
#                x/y coordinates of the tagged client, but only on views that
#                have this tag, too. It expects an array with x and y values.
#
#                Example: position [ 10, 10 ]
#                Link:    http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Position
#
# [*resize*]     This property enables the float mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: resize true
#                Links:   http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Resize
#                         http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Resize
#
# [*stick*]      This property enables the float mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: stick true
#                Links:   http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Stick
#                         http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Stick
#
# [*type*]       This property sets the tagged client to be treated as a specific
#                window type though as the window sets the type itself. Following
#                types are possible:
#
#                [*:desktop*]  Treat as desktop window (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP)
#                              Link: http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Clients#Desktop

#                Example: type :desktop
#                Link:    http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Type
#
# [*urgent*]     This property enables the urgent mode for tagged clients.
#
#                Example: stick true
#                Links:   http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Tagging#Stick
