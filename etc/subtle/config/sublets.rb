# == Sublets
#
# Sublets are Ruby scripts that provide data for the panel and can be managed
# with the sur script that comes with subtle.
#
# === Example
#
#  sur install clock
#  sur uninstall clock
#  sur list
#
# === Configuration
#
# All sublets have a set of configuration values that can be changed directly
# from the config of subtle.
#
# There are three default properties, that can be be changed for every sublet:
#
# [*interval*]    Update interval of the sublet
# [*foreground*]  Default foreground color
# [*background*]  Default background color
#
# sur can also give a brief overview about properties:
#
# === Example
#
#   sur config clock
#
# The syntax of the sublet configuration is similar to other configuration
# options in subtle:
#
# === Example
#
#  sublet :clock do
#    interval      30
#    foreground    "#eeeeee"
#    background    "#000000"
#    format_string "%H:%M:%S"
#  end
