#
# == Views
#
# Views are the virtual desktops in subtle, they show all windows that share a
# tag with them. Windows that have no tag will be visible on the default view
# which is the view with the default tag or the first defined view when this
# tag isn't set.
#
# Like tags views can be defined in two ways:
#
# === Simple
#
# The simple way is exactly the same as for tags:
#
# Example:
#
#   view "terms", "terms"
#
# === Extended
#
# The extended way for views is also similar to the tags, but with fewer
# properties.
#
# Example:
#
#  view "terms" do
#    match "terms"
#    icon  "/usr/share/icons/icon.xbm"
#  end
#
# === Properties
#
# [*match*]      This property adds a matching pattern to a view. Matching
#                works either via plaintext or regex (see man regex(7)) and
#                applies to names of tags.
#
#                Example: match "terms"
#
# [*dynamic*]    This property hides unoccupied views, views that display no
#                windows.
#
#                Example: dynamic true
#
# [*icon*]       This property adds an icon in front of the view name. The
#                icon can either be path to an icon or an instance of
#                Subtlext::Icon.
#
#                Example: icon "/usr/share/icons/icon.xbm"
#                         icon Subtlext::Icon.new("/usr/share/icons/icon.xbm")
#
# [*icon_only*]  This property hides the view name from the view buttons, just
#                the icon will be visible.
#
#                Example: icon_only true
