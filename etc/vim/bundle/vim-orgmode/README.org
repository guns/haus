* Description
  Text outlining and task management for Vim based on Emacs' Org-Mode
  ([[http://orgmode.org/]]).

  The idea for this plugin was born by listening to the Floss Weekly podcast
  introducing Emacs Org-Mode (http://twit.tv/floss136). Org-Mode has a lot of
  strong features like folding, views (sparse tree) and scheduling of tasks.
  These are completed by hyperlinks, tags, todo states, priorities aso.

  Vim-orgmode aims at providing the same functionality for Vim and for command
  line tools*.

  *for command line tools and other programs a library named liborgmode is
   provided. It encapsulates all functionality for parsing and modifying
   Org-Mode files.
