# LiteBrite

LiteBrite is a heavily customized dark color scheme for Vim. It is designed
primarily with 256 color terminals in mind and attempts to provide a consistent
experience for a variety of file types.

## Rationale

The world of Vim is full of fantastic themes. There are literally thousands. So
why build another?

In a nutshell, I wanted a dark color scheme that was built for a 256 color
terminal and provided decent support for a variety of file types. While there
are some amazing themes out there, I just couldn't find one that satisfied both
of these constraints.

If you look at the source code for *most* of the available Vim color schemes,
you will likely discover they do not contain many highlights. Often they cover
only a few of the "core" highlights and perhaps some additional ones for
particular file types. As a result your mileage may vary depending on the type
of file you're working with.

This is not totally the fault of theme developer.

To be fair a large portion of this problem lies within syntax files which
either do not cover enough of the target language, make poor linking choices, or
both.
