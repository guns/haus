A small collection of perl extensions for the rxvt-unicode terminal emulator.

Installation
------------
Simply place the scripts you want to install in /usr/lib/urxvt/perl/ for
system-wide availability or in ~/.urxvt/ext/ for user-only availability.
You can also put them in a folder of your choice, but then you have to add this
line to your .Xdefaults/.Xresources:

    URxvt.perl-lib: /your/folder/

See the following sections for information on how to enable the scripts or set
script-specific options and keyboard mappings in your .Xdefaults/.Xresources.


keyboard-select
---------------
Use keyboard shortcuts to select and copy text.

After installing, put the following lines in your .Xdefaults/.Xresources:

    URxvt.perl-ext-common: ...,keyboard-select
    URxvt.keysym.M-Escape: perl:keyboard-select:activate

The following line overwrites the default Meta-s binding and allows to activate
keyboard-select directly in backward search mode:

    URxvt.keysym.M-s: perl:keyboard-select:search

Use Meta-Escape to activate selection mode, then use the following keys:

    h/j/k/l:    Move cursor left/down/up/right (also with arrow keys)
    g/G/0/^/$/H/M/L/f/F/;/,/w/W/b/B/e/E: More vi-like cursor movement keys
    '/'/?:      Start forward/backward search
    n/N:        Repeat last search, N: in reverse direction
    Ctrl-f/b:   Scroll down/up one screen
    Ctrl-d/u:   Scroll down/up half a screen
    v/V/Ctrl-v: Toggle normal/linewise/blockwise selection
    y/Return:   Copy selection to primary buffer, Return: quit afterwards
    Y:          Copy selected lines to primary buffer or cursor line and quit
    q/Escape:   Quit keyboard selection mode
