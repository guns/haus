### Don't flush all addresses on an interface when the primary address is removed

### Strict mode as defined in RFC3704 Strict Reverse Path
### https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ImprovedNetworking/KernelSecuritySettings
###   Checks our routing table against the source address of incoming packets
###   to make sure that they're coming from the interface our routing table
###   says that address is on. Note that this needs to be easily disabled; if
###   some form of advanced routing or policy routing intends traffic from a
###   host to come in one interface and traffic to that host to leave out a
###   different interface, then legitimate packets will be dropped.

### Accept ICMP Redirect only from gateways if we accept it at all

### Enable router mode (remember to change FORWARD chain to DROP)
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

### Prevent errors from TIME_WAIT assassination
