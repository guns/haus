.SH NAME
lein \- Automate Clojure projects

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B lein
[\fITASK\fR [\fIARGS\fR] [\fI, TASK2\fR [\fIARGS\fR] ...\fR]\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Leiningen is for automating Clojure projects without setting your hair
on fire.

Working on Clojure projects with tools designed for Java can be an
exercise in frustration. With Leiningen, you just write Clojure.

.SH TASKS

.B lein help
will show the complete list of tasks, while
.B lein help TASK
shows usage for a specific one.

.B lein help tutorial
has a detailed walk-through of the various tasks, but the most
commonly-used are:

.TP
\fBlein new NAME\fR
generate a new project skeleton
.TP
\fBlein test [TESTS]\fR
run the tests in the TESTS namespaces, or all tests
.TP
\fBlein repl\fR
launch an interactive REPL session and socket server
.TP
\fBlein jar\fR
package up the whole project as a .jar file
.TP
\fBlein install [NAME VERSION]\fR
install a project into your local repository

.SH CONFIGURATION

Leiningen reads its configuration from the
.B project.clj
file in your project root. Either use
.B lein new
to create a fresh project from which to work, or see the exhaustive
list of configuration options with
.B lein help sample.

You can also have user-level configuration that applies for all
projects. The 
.B ~/.lein/init.clj
file will be loaded every time
Leiningen launches; any arbitrary code may go there. This code is
executed inside Leiningen itself, not in your project. Set the
.B :repl-init
key in project.clj to point to a namespace if you want code executed
inside your project.

You can also manage user-level plugins with the plugin task; see
.B lein help plugin

.SH BUGS

Check https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues to see if your
problem is a known issue. If not, please open a new issue on that site
or join the mailing list at
http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/. Please include the output of
.B lein version
as well as your
.B project.clj
file and as much of the relevant code from your project as possible.
